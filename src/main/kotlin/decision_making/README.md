# [Decision-Making](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/decision_making)
- Used to implement the logic
- Create the block or branch of the code

## [Conditional Operator](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/ConditionalOperator.kt)
- Compare between 2 values
- `>` : greater than
- `<` : less than
- `==` : equals with
- `!=` : not equals with
- `>=` : greater than or equals with
- `<=` : less than or equals with

## [If Else Statement](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/IfElseStatement.kt)
- `if` : execute block code if the condition is true
- `else` : execute block code if the condition is false
- how to write `if else statement`
  - `if` without `else`
  - `if` with `else`
  - `if else` without brackets when it only has 1 statement

## [Logical Operator](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/LogicalOperator.kt)
- Perform Operation to `boolean` in `if (boolean)`
- `!` (not) : return the negation of the boolean value
- `&&` (and) : return `true` if both conditions are `true`
- `||` (or) : return `true` if one of the condition is `true`

## [When Expression](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/WhenExpression.kt)
- Select 1 of many code blocks to be executed
- Similar with `switch` from another programming language
- `when` : the keyword
- `(expr)` : the expression value that need to be checked
- `value -> /* code here */` : code block that will be executed if the value and the expression are equals
- `else -> /* code here */` : code block that will be executed if there is no value that equals with expression

## [For Loop](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/ForLoop.kt)
- Execute the block of codes as long as the condition in range is true
- `for` : the keyword
- `(item in a..b)` : the `item` variable still in the ranges of `a` and `b`
- `{ /** code here **/ }` : block of codes that will be executed as long as the condition is true 

## [While Loop](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/WhileLoop.kt)
- Execute the block of codes as long as the condition is true
- Need some syntax to make the condition become false, so it will not be forever loop
- `while` : the keyword
- `(condition)` : boolean condition
- `{ /** code here **/ }` : block of codes that will be executed as long as the condition is true 

## [Do While Loop](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/kotlin/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/operation/DoWhileLoop.kt)
- Execute the block of codes first, then execute them as long as the condition is true
- The codes will be executed at least once
- Need some syntax to make the condition become false, so it will not be forever loop
- `do` : the keyword
- `{ /** code here **/ }` : block of codes that will be executed as long as the condition is true
- `while` : the keyword
- `(condition)` : boolean condition
